# FirstProject
Hi guys, this is the first project I've done, to kind of get familiar with Python. I wanted to know if any experienced programmer could tell me what I did wrong so I could improve myself, and how to make the code shorter and more efficient. Thank you a lot for helping me!
The file I would like you guys to read and comment is "game.py". It's under 200 lines so it's not really long.
I'm a beginner and so far I've only attended CS50's new year seminar.
Thank you once again!
